Overarching story
  Potential for the great shift in the pantheon
    Reason for empire's culling of other religions is that their diety has been forcibly pulled to earth
      desire to restore to full power
    less followers = weaker deities
    long story short place a god's soul on an alter and it will asert dominance
    place a mortal soul and the mortal ascends to normal godhood

The major plot point is the assassination of the emperor

The end of the plot should end with the First Culling and the establishment of the first Barrel and the backing of a Diety
